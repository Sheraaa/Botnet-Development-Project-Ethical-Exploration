# Botnet-Development-Project-Ethical-Exploration

In this C programming project, my team and I have developed a simplified botnet, consisting of a controller and a zombie component. 
Our primary objective is to gain insights into vulnerabilities within code and configurations while emphasizing 
our commitment to the ethical use of these skills.

## Overview

This project explores the development of a simplified botnet using C programming. 
The botnet consists of two main components: the controller and the zombie. 
The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of system programming, network communication 
and security vulnerabilities while emphasizing ethical use and responsible conduct.

## Components

- **Controller**: The controller is responsible for remotely connecting to the zombie(s) and opening a bash session without requiring authentication. It acts as the command center for the botnet.

- **Zombie**: The zombie represents the compromised computer within the botnet. It listens for commands from the controller and executes them on the host system, allowing remote control.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Execute `make` command to build the project using the provided makefile.

3. Run the `zombie` executable on the target machine(s) to act as the compromised host.

4. Run the `controller` executable on your machine to control the zombie(s) remotely.

## Ethical Considerations

This project is solely intended for educational purposes and to better understand potential security vulnerabilities. 
It is essential to emphasize ethical use and respect all legal and ethical boundaries when experimenting with these concepts. 
Do not use this code or knowledge for any malicious purposes.

## Disclaimer

The creators of this project disclaim any responsibility for any misuse, illegal activities, or harm caused by the use of this code. 
Use it responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.
